I'm going to give you a prescription for some medicine to help you get a better night's sleep. Here, you can get this prescription at any pharmacy. Just take one pill about 30 minutes before you go to bed. The prescription is for thirty days. If you're not sleeping well after thirty days, I'd like you to come back in.
